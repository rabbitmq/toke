Toke
====

Requires at least Erlang/OTP R13B01

Toke is a very minimal Erlang driver for Tokyo Cabinet. It only wraps
the hash API (tchdb*) and doesn't even implement all of that.

All keys and values must be binaries.

When you install Tokyo Cabinet, if you're on a 32-bit machine, don't
forget to pass the --enable-off64 flag to configure, otherwise 'large'
support won't work.

You will want to read both the Tokyo Cabinet API Spec
( https://1978th.net/tokyocabinet/spex-en.html#tchdbapi ) and at least
the Public API section of toke_drv.erl. Also see toke_test.erl for how
to use it.
